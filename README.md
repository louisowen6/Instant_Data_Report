# Instant_Data_Report

Data Exploration is the beginning phase in conducting data science project. However, as we know R is more powerful than Python when it comes to the descriptive analytics. However, as a big fan of Python, I am eager to find all way to get the same benefit while still using Python. "DataExplorer" and "RPy2" are the answers. "DataExplorer" is an R package which can produce a single HTML data report in just using 1 function.


Now you can enjoy this attractive package in Python with the help of RPy2.
